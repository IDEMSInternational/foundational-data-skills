    <title>Story</title>
    <p>In the early 1970s, concern was growing about gender equality in higher education in the United States. Against this backdrop, an analysis of admissions data from the University of California, Berkeley caught public attention.</p>
    <p>The numbers seemed clear. When all applications for one year were added together, men were admitted at a higher rate than women. Across the whole university, 44% of male applicants were accepted, compared to just 35% of female applicants. Same institution. Same year. A visible gap. Newspapers reported the figures, and public concern followed. At first glance, the conclusion seemed unavoidable: women were being treated unfairly.</p>
    <p>Before any action was taken, however, a group of statisticians paused. Rather than asking what the numbers showed, they asked a different question: how were these decisions actually made?</p>
    <p>Admissions at Berkeley were not decided by a single central committee. There was no room where all applications were laid out together and judged side by side. Instead, each academic department – physics, history, engineering, literature – made its own decisions. Each department had its own standards, its own number of places, and its own level of competition.</p>
    <p>The university-wide figures were not wrong. But they were telling only part of the story.</p>
    <p>So the data was reorganised. Nothing was changed. No applications were removed or reweighted. The same information was simply looked at in a different way.</p>
    <p>Instead of lumping all applicants together, the statisticians looked at admissions department by department. They asked a simple question: within each department, were women less likely to be admitted than men?</p>
    <p>What they found surprised almost everyone.</p>
    <p>In most departments, women were admitted at the same rate as men. In several departments, they were admitted at a higher rate. The apparent discrimination seemed to vanish.</p>
    <p>So how could women have lower acceptance rates overall if they were not being disadvantaged within departments?</p>
    <p>The answer lay in where people applied. On average, women tended to apply to departments that were more competitive — departments with fewer places and lower acceptance rates for everyone. Men, on average, applied to departments with higher acceptance rates. When all departments were blended together into a single set of numbers, these differences disappeared from view.</p>
    <p>The university was not discriminating. The way the numbers were combined was.</p>
    <p>By mixing together applications from very different departments, the analysis treated unlike situations as if they were the same. It blurred two distinct questions: how applicants were treated within departments, and how departments differed from one another. Treating these as a single problem produced a story that felt convincing, but was wrong.</p>
    <p>This was not a mistake in arithmetic. The calculations were correct. The mistake was in how the situation was understood. The data reflected a layered reality: applicants belonged to departments, and departments belonged to a university. Flattening that layered structure into one set of averages erased important context.</p>
    <p>The consequences were not trivial. A university’s reputation was at stake. A serious accusation was made. Public trust in data-driven conclusions was affected — all because the way decisions were made in the real world did not match the way the data was analysed.</p>
    <p>This case has since become one of the most famous examples of how misleading averages can be. It is often referred to as Simpson’s Paradox. But the deeper lesson is simpler and more important.</p>
    <p>Multilevel data is not about advanced models or complicated equations. It is about recognising how the world is organised.</p>
    <p>Whenever students belong to schools, patients visit clinics, farmers manage plots of land, or survey responses come from households, the data already has structure. Ignoring that structure does not make analysis easier. It makes it dangerous.</p>
    <p><em>This example comes from Bickel, Hammel &amp; O’Connell (1975), Science.
Bickel, P.J., Hammel, E.A. and O'Connell, J.W., 1975. Sex Bias in Graduate Admissions: Data from Berkeley: Measuring bias is harder than is usually assumed, and the evidence is sometimes contrary to expectation. Science, 187(4175), pp.398-404.</em></p>

  <title>This mistake isn't rare. Here's another time it happened.</title>

  <p>
    In the 1980s, researchers compared two surgical treatments for kidney stones: open surgery and percutaneous nephrolithotomy. When all patients were analysed together, percutaneous nephrolithotomy appeared to be more successful overall. On the surface, it looked like the better treatment.
  </p>

  <p>
    But kidney stones vary in size, and size matters. When the researchers separated patients into two groups—those with small stones and those with large stones—the picture changed. Within both groups, open surgery had higher success rates. It worked better for small stones, and it also worked better for large stones.
  </p>

  <p>
    The apparent contradiction came from how treatments were assigned. Patients with small stones were much more likely to receive percutaneous nephrolithotomy, while patients with large or complex stones were more likely to receive open surgery. When stone size was ignored and all patients were combined into one analysis, the treatment taking on the harder cases appeared to perform worse.
  </p>

  <p>
    <em>Takeaway:</em> When outcomes depend on an underlying grouping—such as disease severity—combining data across those groups can reverse the apparent effect of a treatment.

  <introduction>
    <p>
      Many real-world problems require data collected at multiple levels; for example, individuals within households, classrooms within schools, or schools within districts. This topic introduces the concept of multilevel data structures, explaining how they are organised, why they matter, and how they can be analysed effectively.

      Practise reading multilevel data by telling the story of a single household using all four MICS Kenya files. Keep it simple: no joins, no pivots, no graphs <mdash/> just careful look-ups guided by the metadata.
    </p>
    
    <paragraphs>
      <title>Files you will use</title>
      <p>
        Four files are given containing data on:
        <ul>
          <li><p>Households (one row per household)</p></li>
          <li><p>Household Listing / Members (one row per person in the household)</p></li>
          <li><p>Women (15<ndash/>49) (one row per eligible woman)</p></li>
          <li><p>Children (Under-5) (one row per eligible child)</p></li>
        </ul>
        There is an additional file which explains the variable names for these four data sets.

      <title>Key idea</title>
      <p>
        The column <c>HID</c> is a unique household ID that appears in all four files. If <c>HID</c> is not present in a file, use the household identifiers noted in the metadata, e.g., cluster + household.

      <title>Your task (150<ndash/>250 words)</title>

        Pick one household by <c>HID</c> and write a short report that uses information from each of the four files. Use plain language; include variable names once where helpful.
      </p>
      <p>
        Be level-aware: household facts come from the Households file; person facts from the Members file; the woman's facts from the Women file; under-5 facts from the Children file.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Submission:</em> Upload a document or plain text containing your 150<ndash/>250 word report, and a short <q>Variables used</q> list (just the codes you looked at, e.g., HI10, HL4A, MELEVEL, IM1).

        HID 135050 had an interview completed on 19 Sep 2000. The household has 6 members, including 1 eligible woman and 2 under-5s. The roster lists 3 females and 3 males: two adults (head and spouse, 29 and 31) and four children aged 1, 5, 7, 8; the 7- and 8-year-olds are currently in school. The interviewed woman's education is Secondary+. Both under-5s have vaccination cards seen; the 5-year-old attends early learning with 25 hours in the last week.
